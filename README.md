There's a 2048 game. Here we have a logo, a score, a button to start or replay the game and which have 4âœ•4 grid game board with empty and numeric cells. The player can use arrow-buttons to move these cells in each of the four directions to summarize the numbers. One of '2' or '4' cells is added after every move. The game can be over when the player gets the '2048' cell or all of the cells become numeric, and the player can't make any move. At the end of the game, the player can see a message about winning or losing.

I used JS and DOM to create this game.
